	<h3>Something Cool About Me</h3>
	<p>I like to dye my hair a lot. That is one of my favorite ways of expressing myself. Every time I change the xolor I get to choose different colors of clothes and try to make them work together. Its really fun for me and it makes me feel confident. It also allows me to go to the thrift store and buy more clothes, which I love doing.</p>
	<p>I also really like to play the guitar. When I find song that I really like, I imagine myself playing it on stage and it makes me want to learn it. When I do learn it and play it in my room, I just let everything out and jump around my room as if I was on stage. It's truly one of my favorite ways of letting my feelings out. Its not always happy and cheerful. Sometimes theres a sad song that means a lot to me and when I play it, I cry to it. </p>
